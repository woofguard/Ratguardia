The Jester	Thank goodness.		
The Jester	All of you, please rest a moment.		
The Peasant	I see now why you seek The King's employ.		
The Peasant	You are truly the greatest of fools.		
The Jester	That I may be, but I am also alive.		
The Jester	As are you.		
The Cavalier	And what a fine play!		
The Knight	The rest of us were simply mediocre.		
The Peasant	Do not insult me this way.		
The Jester	Please, all of you.		
The Jester	May the next victor follow in my path.
