The Jester	Finally, I've been scouted for the tournament.		
The Jester	If I win, I could become the court's Royal Jester...		
The Jester	...But the only way to ensure my success is to sacrifice my opponents.		
The Jester	I can't bring myself to be so cruel.		
The Jester	Please, let us all survive!		
			
The Peasant	...So we meet. Where are the others?		
The Jester	Ah, hello. It seems they've yet to arrive.		
The Jester	Might I have your name? I am--		
The Peasant	I am not here to make friends.		
The Peasant	I am participating in this tournament to become the royal chef.		
The Peasant	If I can convince The King to source ingredients from my village...		
The Peasant	My people may yet be saved from ruin.		
The Jester	A noble goal, indeed.		
The Peasant	So you understand.

The Jester	...I see.		
The Jester	Might I remind us all that we may all survive this tournament,		
The Jester	even if we do not succeed?

The Jester	...		
The Jester	...Let us begin.
