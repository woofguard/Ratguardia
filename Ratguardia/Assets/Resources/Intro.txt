x	The Families lived in relative peace, and settled their differences with games of cards.			
x	When a great monster emerged from the earth,			
x	the Families swore to use their powers to contain it.			
x	But the King of Chalices saw an opportunity			
x	He bribed the warriors of every Family to join him in conquering the monster.			
x	They chained the great beast, and the King rode upon it like a chariot.			
x	To test his power, the King destroyed the Rings' meager wall and claimed their land.			
x	The monster simply passed through the Wands's magic, and so it too became the King's.			
x	The Swords put up the greatest fight, but even their Queen soon fell.			
x	The King thus abolished the Families and declared the land The Kingdom of Chalices.			
x	To populate his new royal staff, The King created a game, Ratguardia.			
x	This game was modeled after his conquest, designed to filter out the weak.			
x	Those who could survive a Ratguardia tournament are seen as fit to serve The King.		fade out cards, start normal cutscene
